# TODO

This is the stuff I know sucks or had an idea to try later on. I try to focus
on refining existing feature before moving on to newer features.
However, there are sometimes exceptions - depending how important they are to me.

- I want `haAuth` secure stored because of the tokens
- Get rid of `@electron/remote`, it has never been a good idea, but now I found an easier way
- Refine the card component - probably screw antd
- Rooms overview
